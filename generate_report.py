Important Distinction:

1. FEATURE IMPORTANCE (from sklearn):
   • Measures how often a position is CHECKED during decision-making
   • TopLeft(0) has high importance because it's checked in many rules
   • Center(4) has LOW importance because it's rarely checked

2. STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE (from our analysis):
   • Measures how often a position is CHOSEN as the action
   • Center(4) is chosen in 28.8% of games (highest!)
   • TopLeft(0) is chosen in 13.0% of games

Conclusion:
   • Feature importance ≠ Strategic value
   • "Is position X occupied?" (feature) vs "Should I take position X?" (action)
   • The AI DOES prioritize center for opening, despite low feature importance

Strengths:
  ✓ Successfully learned optimal opening (center prioritization)
  ✓ High performance retention from neural network to decision tree (97.7%)
  ✓ All rules have 100% confidence (deterministic, interpretable)
  ✓ Learned defensive patterns (all rules check opponent positions)

Potential Improvements:
  • 59 rules may be more than necessary (possible overfitting)
  • Could experiment with max_leaves parameter to get simpler tree
  • Consider pruning low-frequency rules (those used <10 times)

Interpretability Achievement:
  • Successfully distilled DQN (black-box) into 59 IF-THEN rules
  • Top 5 rules explain 50% of behavior
  • Rules are human-readable and verifiable
  • Can be audited for fairness, safety, compliance

Research Contributions:
  • Demonstrated VIPER algorithm on TicTacToe domain
  • Showed trade-off: 2.3% performance loss for full interpretability
  • Revealed feature importance ≠ strategic importance insight
